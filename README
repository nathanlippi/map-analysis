I have heard of software that does something similar to this.  

I made this code to get a bit more experience with Lisp, and also to see if I can make the processing go an order of magnitude more quickly than the original program.

This has a basic Common Lisp back end for generating and taking a grid of data that represents different map elevations.

The backend is then capable of calculating the relation of each point to the average of the other points within a certain distance.

See the below grid for an example.  Each number represents an elevation:

+-+-+-+
|3|2|1|
+-+-+-+
|2|5|2|
+-+-+-+
|2|3|1|
+-+-+-+

The average of all the cells surrounding the middle cell is 2.  The value of the middle cell is 5.

5/2 gives us a computed value of 2.5 for the middle cell.

When you analyze an entire map, this calculation is done for each cell that has enough points around it within the given radius (right now, for convenience's sake, we compute a square using the radius, not a circle).

The javascript front end shows us some basic functionality.  

You can retrieve randomly-generated maps from the backend and display them; elevations have color codes ranging between green and red.  

You cannot currently display the processed map, however, though it probably would take less than an hour of hacking.
