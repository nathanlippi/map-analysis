I have heard of software that does something similar to this.  

I made this code to get a bit more experience with Lisp, and also to see if I can make the processing go an order of magnitude more quickly than the original program.

This has a basic Common Lisp back end for generating and taking a grid of data that represents different map elevations.

The backend is then capable of calculating the relation of each point to the average of the other points within a certain distance.

See the below grid for an example.  Each number represents an elevation:

+-+-+-+
|3|2|1|
+-+-+-+
|2|5|2|
+-+-+-+
|2|3|1|
+-+-+-+

The average of all the cells surrounding the middle cell is 2.  The value of the middle cell is 5.

5/2 gives us a computed value of 2.5 for the middle cell.

The javascript front end shows us some basic functionality.  

You can retrieve randomly-generated maps from the backend and display them.  You cannot currently display the processed map, however, though it probably would take less than an hour of hacking.
